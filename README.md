# python-examples
A collection of python code examples for learning python as well as for reference.

## Dependency Needs
Eventually in these tutorials you will need python-dotenv.
```shell
# macOS 
pip3 install python-dotenv

# windows?
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Modules

I reuse a data file throughout the tutorials to demonstrate various functionality: `/data.py`

## Other Files

* `names.csv` I pull a list of names to use in the data module from this csv file

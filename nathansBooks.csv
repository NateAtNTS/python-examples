Book one felt a little disjointed trying to keep up with all the generational hops. Book two has that as well, but seems a little easier to follow. This was an easy book to read, and was good enough it was an easy choice to to pick up book three.</p>"

It covers the basics with good illustrations, it is a good reminder for all of us to review from time to time. I wouldn't call this a very deep book, but that isn't a criticism. I could see it also used as a great book to think/study through as a small group or a Sunday School class. </p>"

It was an easier read than Dune was, and overall I enjoyed it. However, I will say that for all of Dune's challenges, Dune provides a richer narrative fabric than Foundation does. My only complaint for Foundation book one is that it is a little challenging to be moved from one generation to the next and still do good character development. Asimov does decent at this, but I think it could be better.</p>"

Dale Johnson Jr.,Finding Hope in Biblical Community,"<p>I agree with the core tenants of the sufficiency of Scripture and the church’s responsibility / ability to care for people’s souls. I even share the concern that Jay Adams and many others have outlined - that the church gave up too much ground to psychology in the first half of the twentieth century. However, I have become increasingly concerned with the biblical counseling movement’s view which claims that the secular has nothing good to offer. This book interweaves this perspective from the biblical counseling movement, and thus it was troubling to me. Clearly there are parts to the secular that are useless to the Christian, but there are also aspects of it that are very helpful as well. Although the minutiae of what part of secular is helpful and what part isn’t is a difficult conversation, the troubling part to this book is that it overwhelmingly and perhaps exclusively values the insights of the biblical counseling movement. This orients people in God’s church against any data / studies that the secular might have to offer.</p>

<p>Also, I was shocked at the brevity of the “case study” at the beginning of chapter one. It was one paragraph. Then, I was shocked again at the swift application of Johnson’s premise to the case study in paragraph two. No effort was put into probing the complexities of the human brokenness of the people in the case study.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be this negative on this book, but it is just where I am at. It has plenty of good content, but the concerns I shared above really overrode it’s good aspects. </p>

What has been written from the biblical counseling perspective (at least what I have read), has been significantly anemic. For those reasons I was eager to read Allberry's book, and I consider his work in it a good start. He touches on the major biblical passages and collates them with helpful illustrations along the way.</p>
<p>The major omission in this book as well as with much of Christian literature is the topic of psychological trauma and how it relates to our bodies. There is a large segment of the population out there that is trying to process psychological trauma in conjunction with their psychosomatic union. And, with much of Christian literature failing to address this, some Christians are underserved because they do not fit the narrative of the popular Christian literature. </p>"

Lentz,The Concise Business Handbook for Pastors,"<p>I think most pastors will have been taught in Bible school/seminary the things that this book contains. However, it can serve as a concise reference book in some situations. It seems that its usefulness would be pretty limited because it is so short. Maybe it would be good as a supplemental textbook for a ministry training class.</p>"

Rainer,Discovering the Attitude that Makes the Difference,<p>The greatest strengths of this book is that it is short and simple. I would not call it even close to profound. But it is helpful. There are times when you need to pull a simple tool off the shelf. Most people will be able to read this within an hour or two. It can help reshape our perspective when we are tempted to get selfish on our perspective on church.</p>

I have never been abused during my pastoral ministry; however, I have experienced some abusive treatment that could have developed into formal abuse. Thankfully, the person/people were prevented/stopped in one way or another. I don't think I have read another book that looks honestly at how a pastor can handle abusive treatment; so, that makes me thankful for this book. I'm sure there are others, and I am just not aware of them. </p>
<p>This book is fairly comprehensive and it sites its sources for further study. I think some more attention needs to be given to this topic. In seminary, I don't recall being taught how to have healthy expectations for how a church treats you and what to do about it if you are not being treated properly. Maybe I just have not been paying attention.</p>"

Rainer,12 WAYS TO KEEP YOURS ALIVE,"<p>Short, easy read. I find it to be accurate even if it is painful. It is diagnostic but sensitive. It is a must read for those who even have a hint of concern for the health of their church. Perhaps even for those who think they are a part of a healthy church so they can consider what their part is for helping it stay healthy. This book serves a narrow purpose, and it should be one diagnostic tool among many for churches.</p>"

However, I am truly going to stop with this second book. The way Herbert weaves together spiritual mysticism, concepts of leadership, and the sci-fi genre isn't my preference. I can see why there are enthusiasts with this series, but it ultimately doesn't strike a chord with me. I do value the complexity of his plot and how he weaves it together. There are a few areas in his plot resolution in this book that Herbert seems to be a little shallow.</p>"

Over the last few years I have read multiple series to my kids, and therefore, this series is automatically compared to the previous ones. I would recommend it to anyone, and it was a joy to read. If I were to compare it to the Green Ember series, I think in a few ways this series is better than the Green Ember, and, in many ways, it is not quite as good. The Green Ember series performed steadier than this series. That said, one of my kids thought the Green Ember series was boring and loves this series. </p>
<p>The ending of this book surprised me, and I'm not sure I like it. It is a bitter-sweet ending, and I think those are necessary. Yet, I feel like it could have resolved in a deeper way than it did. I won't say too much more so I don't spoil anything. I will say that the Green Ember ending and the Chronicles of Narnia ending were much better in my opinion.</p>"

Jones,The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity,"<p>This was a difficult book to read; however, it is a necessary book. Jones draws strong conclusions, but they do seem necessary. I feel like I cannot properly asses this history because it feels mostly removed from my experience. Yet, Jones extensively lays out how he considers racism to be embedded into white evangelicalism, and this means he would consider me to be affected by white supremacist views. This is a little hard to swallow; however, if it is true, I want to fairly consider how this is so and seek to correct it.</p>

Esau McCaulley is articulate and theologically rich while at the same time vividly sharing the raw pain and emotion that surely surrounds this topic.

Jefferson makes the biblical case for what a Pastor/Shepherd is and how he should be properly oriented and motivated through positive and negative examples. This is an older book, and in some ways feels out of touch with what my generation of pastors face. However, there are plenty of timeless truths on the book that are sure to cause a healthy reflection. Occasionally I felt like Jefferson was a little too negative. </p>"

In addition, in volume 2 I felt like there was a little too much broad brushing in regards to Protestantism and Catholicism. It seemed like it should have been a little longer and with more nuance. That said, I did mostly appreciate the attempt at a honed generalist approach (if you can ever succeed at that!). Like I said for volume one, I wish Gonzalez would have given us a much more extensive sources list. He does give some suggested readings and some notes, but they are brief. </p>"

He uses contemporary wording and analogies along with some key words from psychology. This will be a help to many a modern reader. I expect there will be several parts of the book that I will appreciate for years to come. Hopefully I'll read it again in a year or two.</p>
<p>My one main concern with the book is that there wasn't enough nuance at the end of the book as Ortlund exhorts the reader to be a part of the body of Christ. I agree with this application, but people who are dealing with big T or little t trauma in their lives will find the lack of nuance confusing as they try to process their trauma. It is this lack of nuance that can re-traumatize as well as damage a person's relationship with God's church.</p>"

I can see how enthusiasts would love this book, and I can see how the rest would be disappointed by it.

González,The Early Church to the Reformation,"<p>Gonzalez strikes a nice balance between detail and ease of reading. Thus, this book accessible to a wider audience. That said, this is still quite a commitment to read at over 500 pages. And, this is just volume one. The way I look at church history, is that I need to make several passes the the various church history books to get it engrained in me. I look forward to reading this one again in a few years.</p>
<p>My one complaint with Gonzalez is that he hardly gives any sources. It is hard to use this book to dig deeper.</p>"

My feelings on the book are mixed. It does feel like a hyper critical book, but it points to common realities. It it is probably the most thorough diagnostic book I have read for the pastor to evaluate his heart. However, I can't shake the feeling that it is too heavy, too critical. That said, I suspect if I had visited all the churches that Tripp has visited and seen all that he has seen, I would want to communicate them as he has in this book.</p>
<p>So, I would call this book helpful, best in class, but not for everybody in all seasons of ministry.<br /></p>"

I tried to read it slower this time. I wanted to absorb its contents even more.<br /></p>
<p>The prevailing mindset of our culture of big and impressive has so affected my thinking. Stephen Witmer lays out a gospel-centered and thorough approach to how to re-think ministry in small places. It is like loosening a knot or slowly removing a tangle of thorns. Witmer, iteration by iteration, helps us dislodge our wrong thinking in light of the Scriptures. He acknowledges and engages those who have made a strong case for ministering in the city, but he doesn’t give up. He offers some respectful counter arguments. And, he references an impressive array of references which help deepen our considerations. I would be curious to read some other treatments of this topic. I wonder if Stephen Witmer has pretty much covered it.</p>
<p>I might read this again next year, and I am considering buying several copies and passing it out to people. I purposefully did not read my last review of this book before writing this review of it. I wanted my thoughts from this read through to be independent of what I wrote previously.</p>"

American's memory is short and their perspective is one of self-interest. I don't blame America for this. It is normal. </p>
<p>But normal isn't always good or best. Sometimes it is tragic. </p>
<p>John Ghazvinian takes us back to the colonial days of the U.S. and begins to trace our history with Iran from that point forward. He writes as a historian who is both an Iranian and an American which makes him uniquely situated to outline the tragic but normal behavior of the United States toward Iran. Those who are old enough to have watched the media coverage of Iran over the last 40 years will likely take great exception to the charge that the U.S. has not treated Iran properly, and likely many will say that Iran has deserved what it has gotten. And, I understand this perspective. But it is still tragic. There is a lot more to the story. I think many would have a more moderate stance if they knew more.</p>
<p>Ghazvinian's hope (and I share this hope) is that if more people would engage the facts of history, this tragedy could be averted. He doesn't just charge America with guilt. He is not an America basher. He writes as an historian who helps his readers examine the fabric of the situation which occasional editorial phrases/descriptors. He not only reveals the regrettable actions of the U.S. but also those of Iran. He does not give Iran a free pass. And, he does a great job exposing the pressure points of both nations. </p>
<p>Ghazvinian does lead the reader to the conclusion without expressly stating it (If I'm remembering correctly) that America perhaps has the greater blame and greater responsibility. Perhaps that is not his intention, but that is how I take it. And, I don't resent it. I agree with him. I'm curious to hear from other truly informed people who disagree with him.<br /><br /></p>"

Some parts were too slow for me. The plot definitely gets more complex in book three with some significant surprises. I continue to enjoy the themes of right/wrong, light/darkness, good/evil in Peterson's writing.</p>
<p>I have been reading this to my children, and I like to watch their responses to the book. They seem to be pretty into it for the most part. 4 out of my 5 children are engaged. My youngest who is in kindergarten is still too young to appreciate it.<br /></p>"

Nouwen's introduction felt weird and a little off to me. I understood what he was trying to get at, but how he got there just wasn't that great in my opinion. And, as the book progressed he uses next to no Scripture quotations and only a few allusions.</p>
<p>However, as I got into the middle of the book my respect for it started to build, and as the book ended, I do have an appreciation of it. Nouwen approaches things just different enough, that once I got past the things that I felt were weird (mostly), then the rest I found helpful and though provoking. I especially appreciated his description and applications surrounding leadership.</p>"

It attempts to give a fresh view of what composes a healthy church, especially in light of the recent years of COVID and such. What I have heard is that many people have drifted and left the church during these times. (I have not seen that much in my personal experience.) Many pastor-scholar-authors will often write to help God's church process the current times in light of the timeless truths of the Bible, and that is what Jonathan Leeman and Collin Hansen are seeking to do here.</p>
<p>I view this book as a great tool to have conversations about church in today's context. These conversations should be with those are are still in church as well as those who have left in recent years. Whenever we can talk through the big doctrines of Scripture in light of current context, it will strengthen God's church. Books like this provide an official storehouse that we can draw off of while we seek to have these conversations.</p>
<p>There were a couple things that bothered me about the book. I consider the case for church membership to be overdone and the case for believers baptism to be underdone. But, I'm not a pastor-scholar-author. These guys have done something I cannot do myself, and I am grateful for their work.</p>"

One of the characteristics I appreciate about a historian which Shirer possesses is the ability to bring dimension to situations in an interesting way. The unavoidable byproduct of covering Nazi Germany is that the book is rather dark and discouraging. Shirer does help some with how he organizes the material. If you as a reader are remotely willing to engage history for the sake of perceiving the present, this is a must read.</p>"

It is more that reading an official presentation of these things will cause them to stand out bigger in my thinking and thereby help me give better attention to their value. </p>
<p>That said, I have personally had a strong aversion to these things for many years that has only grown stronger with time. These types of approaches seem cheap to me, and Robert Cialdini tries to address this in his book.

It truly is like saying goodbye to old friends. I took a peak at other reviews of this book on Goodreads, and I was surprised at some of the criticisms. Many folks found the first part of the book boring. This wasn't the case for me at all. The best feature of this book series is what shone the brightest in this final book - the mental processing of gifted children, all in their own way, coalescing around their relationships with one another...which, perhaps for others, was the boring part. Not sure. This for me, however, was enthralling and probably helpful for my own thinking processes. </p>"

<p>On the whole, I liked the book. Subjectively, however, I felt like Miller went into too much detail sometimes. I gleaned a ton of great info on Chicago, but usually the first third of the chapter was enough, and then the rest felt like extra that only an enthusiast would want. And, perhaps that is who Miller is targeting here. I have a book on NYC that I am going to read soon, and we will see what I think of that. I'm wondering if I don't like to read the history of cities as much as individuals or countries. </p>"

Books one and two felt similar (that is perhaps not a fair statement, but in contrast to book three is seems fair), but still very enjoyable. Here in book three, Steward shakes things up. It's the same characters with the same abilities, but with some twists. In addition, there are portions of this book that stirred strong emotion in me (in a good way) as I experienced the bond between the characters as they go through difficult times. There is a surprising amount of resolution in this book, so I am curious what book four will bring.</p>"

From beginning to end this event contained a surprising amount of complexity. I felt the Jonathan Franklin did a good job portraying this complexity while at the same time weaving it all together into a compelling account. Since the beginning of time, people have tried to shape the historical record for their purposes; however, this seems especially true in the day of visual media. Thus, when I read historical records such as this one that happened during modern media times, I appreciate the effort to bring all the factors together in a seemingly accurate way.</p>
<p>My only complaint is not any fault of the author. There are several elements to this story that are rougher, darker, and baser in nature. They were a part of the story, and I prefer to not have too much exposure to things like that. They are probably no big deal to most people.</p>"

I bought the series for my children to read, and my 2nd oldest read them first, and then my oldest read them next. They loved the books, and they were excited when Disney+ started to come out with video installments of book one. We watched the first two right after they came out, and we were eager to watch the rest as the came out. At the end of watching these first two, my second oldest, Jonathan, came up to me with book one and said, ""Here you go Dad"" with the expectation that I would read it. It was fun to have the bond over the Harry Potter series with my older two kids, so I decided I would read this series too. </p>
<p>Now, onto my review.</p>
<p>I have no complaints and only delights with this first book. One particular delight is that this series capitalizes upon the feelings and unique abilities of gifted children. What's more, these gifted children are what is called ""Twice Exceptional"" which can be abbreviated ""2e"" (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_exceptional"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Wikipedia article</a>). Perhaps some would debate my considering them 2e, but I think it is worth considering. Gifted children often have deep struggles with how they relate to the society around them, and they often do not understand why. This can go even deeper for 2e children. That is why this book serious brings such delight because here is a book series who seems to keenly understand this.<br /></p>
<p>As to the particular plot of this first book, Stewart does a good job drawing you into the fairly quickly; however, I wonder how broad the appeal would be because of the oddities that appeal to gifted children within the plot. That's not a bad thing, I'm just curious about it. Another beautiful part of this first book is how the children, although intensely gifted, discover their significant limitations, and how they must rely, like the Harry Potter series, on the community of their friends - even when they are not get along with their friends. Lessons of trust, facing your fears, following instructions, etc. abound throughout the book. </p>
<p>I won't say too much so I don't give any spoilers, but I will say this: The children start with deep loss, and they end with great gain. </p>"

Rowling,Book 6,"<p>Book six felt the most unique out of the series so far (not counting book one of course). The surprises, joys, sadness, and the ebb and flow of intensity just felt different. As Harry gets older, the complexity of the issues correspondingly get more difficult, and he observes the limitations of the adults in his life more keenly. Harry's weight of responsibility dramatically increases, and his relationships, although sometimes stormy, become even deeper. Some long-standing tensions in the storyline get resolved, and some get unexpectedly brought to the forefront. As I've mentioned before, although these books are significantly other worldly, they are firmly rooted in our experience in this world. As I am now approaching my 40s, I find myself able to dwell on these things in a new way, and get much more application out of them. </p>"

I am still enjoying the series, though. The dynamics of relationships are the most vivid in this book so far, and I once again, appreciate the vivid realities that we experience in this world couched in a very much other-worldly plot line. The way Rowling moves Harry through events keeps us from a messiah complex while valuing his unique abilities and relationships. </p>"

Bahnsen (Contributor),Counterpoints Series,"<p>I value what the Counterpoints series does. It really helps you hash things out. One unavoidable limitation is that the individual authors have space limitations which prevents them from fully developing things and overcoming foreseen objections. So, for what they do accomplish in such a short space is noteworthy and spectacular to observe. However, you know that the responses will lampoon one another over aspects that are not worth poking at because of the limitations they all faced. </p>
<p>I found this particular book in the series to be a blend of helpful responses and ones that were unnecessarily aggressive. Beyond that, by the time you get to the end, you get a clear idea of which biblical texts are the battle ground ones. </p>
<p>I had to read this book under a time crunch. Therefore, I don't feel like I got as many questions answered as I wanted to. I think that is partially my fault, partially due to the complexity of the issues, and partially because the various views digress too much. </p>"

<p>One of my big take-aways from this book is the Prussian Nationalism, its relationship to religion and politics, and how that relates to the United States today. It is very easy to make your assessment of another country based on what it is infamous for - World Wars 1 and 2 in Germany's case. However, as is the case with any person you interact with on an individual basis, it is a mistake to evaluate an individual or a country without considering where they are coming from. People are prone to make this mistake over and over again - myself included. </p>
<p>This book can help us consider this in light of our prevailing view of World War Germany and how they got there. Looking forward to spending more time with these lessons in the years to come.</p>"

Harmon,Inaugurated Eschatology for the Life of the Church,"<p>In my reading experience, this is a rather unique book targeted to pastors / elders / church leaders. It is a theologically rich book with the actuated goal of being tethered to the life of the church in a practical way. Gladd and Harmon carry forward Beale's life-long work of presenting God's Kingdom in an eschatological perspective from beginning to end. As the subtitle says, they pay special attention to how this applies to the church today. </p>
<p>Overall they did a good job seeing this through, however, I felt several times the scales tipped too far towards continuity and an amillennial approach. For folks who lean towards dispensationalism, they will have to squint at a few of the ways some of the biblical texts are handled. However, I believe it is worth it to consider the book's premise. </p>
<p>One other minor weakness in my opinion is that the book can be a little choppy as rich theological concepts are applied to the life of the church. A lot of detail is given to bringing Beale's premise to this book in a practical way. It is just hard to do that in a short book. It is hard to move from depths of the New Testament Use of the Old Testament and how that applies to the practical daily life of the church.</p>"

Now that I have finished the book, for the most part I do not think that is what will happen with this book. Although, I think it will charge up the wrong people in the wrong way in some cases, I think his content goes deeper than what shallow, reactionary activism wants to go. <br /></p>
<p>This book runs in an already familiar thought groove for me. But, it is not the same ole stuff that has been rattling around in my mind for years now. Dreher brings new thoughts to the table with some excellent solutions that he gleaned from those who lived through and some who died under brutal totalitarian regimes. <br /></p>
<p>I agree with Rod that the seeds of totalitarianism are sprouting in America albeit a ""soft totalitarianism"" as he calls it. And, I agree that the potential to completely take over public life in an ugly way can happen over night. What is difficult to agree with him on is for us to live in the urgency that this has already happened. I do find value in the preparatory steps he offers for us to pursue now for when that day will come. I just have a part of me that recoils at a call to Christian dissidence at this point in my Christian experience in America. I suspect that if I were having a personal conversation with Dreher he would point out the fact of my relative youth and inexperience. And, I don't disagree with him. But, how can I live as if I am in something that I am not with the wisdom I would have gain from it if I had? And again, I suspect that he would reply saying, well, that is why I wrote this book. And back to him I would reply, thank you. I will be thinking on this. </p>"

I suspect most reactions to this book will be on the extremes of loving or hating. Maybe I'm wrong about that. My reaction is mixed and conflicted. </p>
<p>My favorite thing about this book is the treasure trove of source references it gives to evangelicalism over the last one hundred years. Most of the people I was familiar with, some I was not. Among the people I was familiar with, most of the negative things Du Mez points to, I was familiar with, but there were some surprises.</p>
<p>My second favorite thing was how Du Mez correlated her source material to support her premise. This does not mean that I agree with her, nor does it mean that I disagree with her. I consider it much more complicated than an either-or approach. The reason I liked how she correlated her source material to support her premise is because it broadened and deepened my understanding of the people and dynamics at stake as it relates to American Christian Nationalism. I have become deeply concerned with how many Christians have not been able to sort out their Christianity from the brand of Christian Nationalism that has been handed to them. </p>
<p>Another thing I liked about the book is how it throughly went after the culture of power and corruption in American Evangelicalism. As Du Mez demonstrates, there is a long line of problems with this within American Evangelicalism. </p>
<p>Finally, I am grateful for how this book will make me think. It is good for all of us to read something that challenges our thinking. And this book does just that.</p>
<p>There are also some concerns I have with this book.</p>
<p>Du Mez covered an incredible about of material. Although I cite that as a benefit above, I also consider it a negative. Du Mez applies her narrow premise to decades of people and situations. Truly, there is enough of her premise within these to write a cohesive book rings that true to a large amount of people. But I believe her premise is significantly too narrow for the span people and situations she applies it. I see this as leading to further polarization instead of productive talks for a solution.</p>
<p>Speaking of a solution, this brings me to my next concern. It is one thing to criticize people - even people that need it. It is another thing to offer a positive model. Perhaps some would view Du Mez's comments on egalitarianism toward a positive model. Even so, this would barely touch the surface. A book with such extensive criticism with barely any positive direction is very unhelpful to American religious culture. Sure, we need to hear these things. But, after you tell us these things, invest in a positive direction for us.</p>
<p>I do not know much about Kristin Kobes Du Mez. I did a little bit of searching online, but I still don't have a very good sense. As I listened to this book, it feels like I high view of the Scriptures is indefensible in Du Mez's mind. We should never excuse the improper behavior of someone who does hold to a high view of the Scriptures. That is not what I am talking about here. It seemed to me that Du Mez thought both the Scriptures and the people were the problem here.</p>
<p> I listened to this book on Audible. I considered it valuable enough to order a hard copy so I can continue to study it and its sources.</p>"

So, it was somewhat interesting to read Arnold Pent's account of their travels. His writing style is matter-of-fact with quite a bit of dry humor thrown in. For me, the book was interesting for the first several chapters, and then after that, not so much. The context this family ministered in is worlds away from where we live today in America. Also, even during the time they did minister, they were so much different than most American families. I wonder if the people who would be most interested in this book are those who knew the family or who have never travelled like that before. </p>
<p>The standout benefit of the book is reading how well they knew the Bible. I think it would encourage most of us that there is more we can do in this way.</p>"

Getz,God's Plan for Leading the Church,"<p>This book was recommended to me by another ministry leader, and it was a joy to read. It takes a thorough, diagnostic approach to church leadership, looking for what it calls ""supracultural"" principles: truths that should be applied no matter the culture. Gene Getz works really hard to ""stick to the facts"" and stay close to the Scriptures, acknowledging when there is room for difference of form. </p>
<p>This is probably the best book I have read on the topic. The one weakness it has, if you can call it that, is that although it does talk about what small churches can do, the large majority of this book applies to ministries that are mid-sized ministries (150+ people) and larger. And, these days, the majority of churches are smaller than that. </p>
<p>I expect to go back to this book many times over the years.</p>"

And then, the obvious occurred to me: this is a little book designed for hitting the major points of what church is and how Christians should relate to it. When I look at it that way, it is an excellent little book. In fact, It is a great book to hand out to people at my church.</p>"

Some would call it too dark for children to read (the seeming intended audience), but I'm not sure so I could say that myself definitively. </p>
<p>Hoban does include a strong dose of reality, and depending on the child's background this reality could really resonate with them. Perhaps that is what I found odd about the elements of the book. The elements were woven together in such a way that a child can appreciate them, yet there is much for an adult to appreciate in the book. Perhaps that is Hoban's genius here. There's something for all ages in a tasteful way. The reader of any age can appreciate the complexities of life and human nature, and how things can resolve, and then not resolve.<br /></p>

I listened to it, and I hope to read the hard copy in the next couple years. I don’t retain as much when I listen to a book. But, it is better than not getting to the book at all. </p>
<p>I like how Toby Wilkinson lays out the content. He has a good combination of detail and story telling. As I listened, I found myself wondering how we can know so much information on such an ancient civilization. I’ve studied how archaeological finds have actually enabled us to know all this, but it is still astounding how much we now know. I’m sure there must be some guesswork, but I’m not able to discern what is and what is not. </p>
<p>As is normal for me, my most interesting part of histories is when countries interact with each other. This book is rich with these interactions - especially as it moves into the first millennium. Some of these include Libya, Israel, Assyria, Greece, etc. </p>

<p>Martyn Lloyd-Jones (MLJ) is an excellent expositor of the Scriptures, and I think that is where he shines best. The contents of this book is a collection of sermons, speeches, and radio addresses over a period of time. During the time they were originally given, people would have likely been very pleased because of his reputation and timely words. The core principles are good, but much of the other content (i.e. current situation, outlook in the world, manner of speaking, illustrations) are out of date. And, it is less compelling to read a compilation of of someone's speaking than a book specifically prepared for the subject of its title.</p>"

Levine is much more opinionated on origins and spirituality than what I see as normal for books of this type; however, I see the value of his reasons. His message of paying attention to the way animals respond like what humans respond is essential - even if you don't agree with his view on origins and spirituality.</p>"

Frazier,Sorting Through the Speculations,"<p>T. L. Frazier explains his view of the Second Coming from his view in the Orthodox Church. In addition, he aggressively confronts his representation of dispensational theology. If Frazier had just stuck to articulating his position, I would have rated this book a 4 out 5 stars. However, his aggressive criticism of his caricature of dispensationalism really diminishes the quality of his presentation. </p>
<p>If you already share his view of eschatology or if you already on your way out of the dispensational way of thinking, then you will love this book. And, it is always good, no matter what your position, to read someone who thinks differently than you. That is not my concern with Frazier here. </p>
<p>There is an enormous amount material and nuance in the field of eschatology. Because I am fairly familiar with the dispensational view, as I read Frazier's representation of it, he seems highly selective and sometimes inaccurate. However, where he seems inaccurate to me, it is likely that he has chosen some part of dispensationalism that has held the view he is targeting at some time. There are plenty of things to target in it, and there has been no shortage of kooks who hold its positions. Frazier gets into trouble when he tries to represent all of dispensationalism, his entire view, and then make application as if dispensationalism is dangerous - all in a fairly short book. </p>
<p>That said, there are many things I enjoyed about this book. There were several sources that I was not familiar with that I hope to be so in the future. I also like reading someone who thinks very differently about things than I do. And finally, I appreciate how Frazier challenges the modern evangelical view of modern Israel. There are some things to think about there.</p>"

I quickly ordered the book, and started it within the same day it came in the mail. The need for good books handling trauma and Christian theology is great. So, it was all the more disappointing that this book did not do a good job. </p>
<p>Jennifer Baldwin gives a decent overview of the components of trauma, but her writing style was the least accessible I have read on the topic. It seemed unnecessarily complicated. She also does an inadequate job handling classic Christian theology. To do this properly is a big job for a short book. However, the premise of the book claims to do so. The bigger problem was that she misrepresents classic Christian theology in several ways. This is a shame because it will cause her good points about the weaknesses the churches and church leaders to likely to be lost on a group that really needs to hear it. </p>
<p>I did find several points of value throughout the book, but its weaknesses significantly outweigh its strengths. I’m still glad I read it, and I will still use it for some reference in the future. </p>"

As I finished the book, I had come to respect and appreciate why she selected the things she did. Susan does acknowledge President Eisenhower's critics along the way, although I found myself wanting to know more of where they were coming from.

However, the reason that it can be rests upon the extensive reading that I have already done. Aundi Kolber gives a multi-disciplinary, broad overview description of the trauma people experience from their family of origin with a systemized approach within the multi-disciplinary, broad overview on how to handle this. I wonder if this great strength could also be a weakness for some. Aundi covers so many helpful concepts that unless a person is already prepared to study this a lot, they may not be prepared to absorb it. This also means that she is not able to dig down as deep on many of the concepts, and some people will not be able to dig deeper. These are just potential weaknesses though. </p>
<p>One of the most helpful concepts Aundi gave me was that of ""white-knuckling."" I already understood the underlying concept, but the visual-practical way the phrase ""white-knuckling"" communicates really hit home for me. That, in tandem with Kolber's main premise of ""try softer,"" made the book unusually powerful for me. </p>
<p>In general, I consider this to be an excellent entry point for Christians wanting to know more about trauma-informed therapy/counseling. I encourage folks to read this book, and then to dig deeper into the footnotes. They give tons of references to some of the most recent work on dealing with trauma.</p>"

<p>After reading Nestor's book, you won't think about breathing the same way again. And, as with any radical premise (in contrast to popular culture), those who are looking for some new thing will be captivated by this book. This is not to say that there isn't substance and research involved - there is plenty of that. It just feels like an oversell with a small disclaimer at the end of the book. </p>
<p>I'm not actually that negative on the book as a whole. The positive aspect of this book is to those who are willing to carefully examine his premise and look at his sources.

It is also a hard book to recommend; however it is an excellent book. The first word of the title captures it - complex.

Pete Walker does a good job helping adults who have gone through difficult family of origin experiences process through a path to thriving. Walker is clear that his book was 30 years in the making, and he offers strategies for people on all points of their journey of healing. </p>
<p>Pete is necessarily repetitive in this book, and I held on longer than I normally would with slowly processing his repetitions. However, because of where I am at in my journey of healing and processing things, I eventually reverted to skimming towards the end of the book. Some people will need to read the whole book slowly, and then pick it up and read it slowly again. I anticipate I will be picking up the book several more times to review its contents.

I think Andrew Robinson did a good job in the introduction explaining why writing a biography of Thomas Young was so difficult. And so, I think that needs to be factored into understanding my responses as I read the book. However, to some degree I wonder if Robinson's reasoning was more of an excuse than a substantive reason. I can't say for sure because this is the only book I have read on Thomas Young. What is clear to me is that this book is not the same caliber of biographical work that I am used to. <br /></p>
<p> As far as biographies go, this is a shorter one. So much about Thomas Young was left unsaid. What increases this mystery is the disproportionate amount of contributions across many different fields of study in which Thomas Young made critical contributions to. On the negative side of my mixed reactions is the fact that there is a lot of focus on the details about contributions that Thomas Young made. I was less interested in these details and more interested in the fabric of who Thomas Young was. My theory is that Robinson, because he could not give the details of who Young was, he filled in more details about what he contributed. What I did find interesting was the significant amount of controversy and conflict that Young was constantly involved in, and Robinson does a good job looking at the details of those.</p>"

It is easy to gain a good grid with which to dig deeper with other works. In other words, this is a a good entry point into archaeological studies. Something else that makes this book interesting is that it was written in 1958. I enjoy reading older books and their corollary views of the the world in which they were written. </p>"

<p>The edition of this book that I started reading from is the one with the ""Special Introduction by Ray Comfort."" I picked it up for a few cents from a sale from our local library. My first comments are relevant to this specific edition. </p>
<p>I was bothered by how this edition was presented. I picked it up, expecting to get the Origin of Species, which I did get - sort of. The first 53 pages are the ""special introduction"" by Ray Comfort and the views expressed there, I would largely agree with. The reason I picked up the book was to read what I wasn't directly familiar with - Darwin's <em>Origin of Species</em> itself. </p>
<p>This is where I am disappointed with this edition. Ray Comfort's ""special introduction"" is at normal type size, but Darwin's <em>Origin of Species</em>"" text is in a much smaller font size, and not easy to read. It feels like a bait and switch and a misrepresentation. It seems that it will make people mad instead of cause them to think.<br /></p>
<h5>Studying the Original Sources</h5>
<p>I am working towards actually reading classic books, like Darwin's, that I know I disagree with. I came to realize that I, along with most of us, can be intellectually anemic with how we interact with concepts. A couple years ago I was interacting on social media with a group of my peers concerning Darwin and evolution. One of them had posted some strong statements about Darwin and his views, and he was being challenged by some on a couple of his points while the rest were cheering him on. I began to wonder if he had actually read Darwin directly, or if he had read other people about Darwin. So, I private messaged him and asked him about it. </p>
<p>He never responded to me. </p>
<p>I got the silent treatment about something that is very important - reading the original sources.</p>
<p>Most if not all of us tend towards writing to our crowd who will cheer us on. And, it is nice to get the cheers and affirmations. I want to go a little deeper than that though. I'm not trying to claim a high ground here for the sake of praise. I want to do look at the sources themselves for true intellectual honesty. I want my faith paired up with intellectual honesty about what I speak for and against. </p>
<h5>On The Origin of Species Itself</h5>
<p>I consider the book itself, from where I sit in my historical context, highly anti-climactical. So much has been published on top of Darwin that the book itself is underwhelming. That, and it is also very long winded. Darwin, slowly and meticulously, presents his theory, plodding through dozens of species and sharing his observations while connecting them to his theory. The large majority of the book is on his observations, and his theory is gently woven throughout them. He does make his case, but it is easy to miss it if you are not interested in all of his observations. It would be easy for anybody to lift case-making statements out of their context and make them say more or less that what Darwin likely intended. </p>"

I loved getting a detailed overview of Martin Luther. And, I consider the wittiness of Eric Metaxas to match that of Luther. Either that, or Metaxas picked up more on Luther's because of his own personality. I cannot tell which. </p>
<p>I was somewhat surprised at the nature and extent of controversy that surrounded Luther even among those who were not in the Catholic Church. However, I am starting to become less surprised as I am exposed to more and more christian historical figures. Their experience, like ours, was difficult and filled with complicated ministry relationships. Another example from a recent book I read was the experience of Jonathan Edwards. </p>
<p>Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I am only giving it a three out of five stars. I am not convinced that Metaxas was careful with how he represented the Roman Catholic Church. Although I would readily agree with his conclusions and representations based on my views, from a more objective perspective, they do not seem to be as carefully presented as some other historians I have read. I mean no disrespect to Eric Metaxas. He is profoundly gifted, and I respect him.</p>"

These goals strikes at the heart of my passion and how I look at life, and reading this book was a rich feast. George Marsden strikes the balance between presenting Edwards' great accomplishments and the realities of his struggles. </p>
<p>I learned so much about the theological views of Edwards' time as well is of the condition of the New England colonies as a whole through this book. It is easy to look back on these folks with criticism and disagreement, and I do not want to do that.

Thus, I find a greater ability to think critically (in a good way I hope) of folks during that time and our time today. </p>"

Not that you can really compare anything to the C. S.

I took a sneak peak at some of the reviews on Goodreads. I don’t always do that before I write my own review so that mine thoughts won’t be tainted. For whatever reason I chose to sneak peak this book. The first several reviews shared various complaints about the quality, focus, and opinions of the author in the text. I was surprised, but I shouldn’t since we are talking about coffee. </p>

<p>First and foremost, this is a history of coffee. As far as a detailed, compelling history, I was satisfied. When there was more detail than I wanted, I switched to meta reading. The scope was fairly comprehensive, and since I like coffee and history, I found it interesting. A bonus benefit was a refresher on many aspects of world history as coffee history weaves its way through it. </p>

<p>One surprise for me was the glimpses I got into how women in American were treated (demeaned) in past generations. These were just mere references, and I don’t know how representative and substantive they were. There must have been enough of this type of treatment for large scale ads to be run like they were. I hope I can learn more. </p>

<p>A bigger crisis is how whole families were treated on coffee plantations for generations. I can appreciate fair trade coffee now much more than I did before. However, I believe I have a lot more to learn on this. </p>

<p>The one thing I wanted more from the book which isn’t necessarily within its scope is a deeper analysis of the coffees on the market today and the matrix of the types of beans and roasting practices. Reading the book through does give a pretty good foundation, and Mark does say how to brew the perfect cup of coffee at the end of the book. Also at the end of the book is an excellent bibliographic essay with lots of further reading. </p>"

I was raised surrounded by people who do not take climate change seriously. After recently watching a TV show series that repeatedly brought up the issue, I decided I wanted to study it for myself. I went to my librarian sister, who is the manager of collection and development for her library system, as I often do, and asked her for some book recommendations. </p>
<p>I couldn't ask for a better first book to read than Hope Jahren's <em>The Story of More</em>. Hope's unassuming, data-driven, and story-driven approach makes for a fun, easy read while at the same time being thought provoking. I found very little that I disagreed with outright, and her modest approach gives room for a reader from any background to accept what see says and think about it. </p>
<p>My sole negative of the book is one that many will not find as a negative. For me, there was too much story with too much laying of ground work. This also may be the book's greatest strength.

It is probably the most accessible book I have read to my children so far. Their enjoyment has been on par with the Chronicles of Narnia up to this point. I am curious to see if they enjoy it a little more when I am done with the series.

I also look forward to reading some of the Arminian sources that Edwards references. </p>
<p>Edwards is brilliant for sure; however with my cursory listening of this book, my opinion is that the basic premise is very simple. Perhaps that contributes to Edwards' brilliance - he takes this simple premise and applies it doggedly and exhaustively. This book is not a biblical exposition, however it does pull from theology. The book is throughly a logical application of theology with logical refutations of those who hold the Arminian view. </p>

It also is a little more fun to review knowing that I have someone I know that has an opinion about it. In the last year, I have read a book on the <a href=""https://nathanbate.com/blog-archive/2019/08/24/iran-a-modern-history-by-abbas-amanat"">history of Iran</a>, <a href=""https://nathanbate.com/blog-archive/2020/02/24/india-a-history-by-john-keay"">the history of India</a>, and the <a href=""https://nathanbate.com/blog-archive/2019/12/20/a-history-china-by-john-keay"">history of China</a>. In all three books, the British were involved in these countries, especially in Iran and India. I am slowly hearing the rest of the story of the affects of British Imperialism, and it is troubling. Many people just don't get it why eastern countries don't like the west, but after digging a little deeper in the history books over the last several years, it is no wonder. </p>
<p>Stephen Kinzer does a good job mapping out the concerns that were on the minds of Britain, Iran, and the US. You can see where all the parties are coming from. He also does a good job laying the historical groundwork for the US/British led 1953 coup of Mossadegh's Democratic Iranian Government, describing the actual event, and decades of the aftermath. Kinzer makes clear in his introduction that he thought the coup was a mistake, but he doesn't resort to trying to prove that. He simply lays out the facts and mindsets from all sides and lets the reader judge. </p>
<p>We will never know what would have been, but I believe that even a cursory look at some of these historical events as well as the aftermath would truly enlighten us on the effects of outsiders trying to reconstruct a nation (India's successor states from the British rule - Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh - are another great example of the disaster). </p>
<p>Stephen Kinzer gives footnotes for further reading and gives us his firsthand account of visiting Mossadegh's home on the 49th anniversary of the 1953 coup in the Epilogue. If you consider yourself moderately willing to read important historical books, this one should be on your list to read. It is rather short and easy to read as these things go.</p>"

So, there needs to be a lot of reconstruction. Also, to be fair, I started this book over six months ago, and I have only read it with fits and starts - with the exception of the last 250 pages.

Jeremy's thorough handling of human complexity deepens biblical counseling in a great way. <br />****<br />Jeremy Pierre in The Dynamic Heart in Daily Life brings a fresh approach to biblical counseling. His premise of the ""dynamic heart"" is truly profound. Sometimes I have felt that Biblical counseling fails to take in the complexity of the human experience while at the same time criticizing those who do as being unbiblical. This is simplistic - I know. Yet, I think there is some validity to it. Jeremy brings some more breadth and depth to the handling of human experience in biblical counseling. He even briefly deals with the physical body and safety. This doesn't seem to be dealt with much in biblical counseling. Maybe I will stand corrected the more reading I do, but it seems that Jeremy feels the need to defend even bringing this up if you read the footnote number three in chapter 5 (page 248).<br /><br />I thought that the third and last section of the book wasn't as good as the first two sections. It felt very repetitive and mechanical in such a ""dynamic"" book. I would call this section thorough though. If you want to get your mind going before a counseling appointment, skimming this third section would be helpful.</p>"

I am upgrading it to five out of five stars. One of the things I caught from the print version that I didn't from the Audible version is that the biblical counseling movement IS willing to glean valuable data from secular sources while still standing on the sufficiency of the Scriptures.<br />*****</p>
<p>My original review</p>
<p>It has been at least 15 years since I have read anything on biblical counseling. Since then I have done a lot of reading in the realm of secular psychology. I remain committed to the sufficiency of Scripture, but I have discovered a lot of helpful tools and metrics used in secular psychology since my college &amp; seminary days. A broad-brushed feeling I had of these resources right after my schooling was that these resources were suspect at best and more likely just not good at all. I know that isn't a fair representation in many cases, it was just what I left my schooling with. <br /></p>
<p>Although dealing with this deeply isn't the scope of Heath Lambert's book, I felt like he at least gave a helpful, detailed handling of it. He begins the book sorting out what he calls ""Christian Counseling"" versus ""Biblical Counseling"" and where they are similar and where they are different. Naturally, he makes his case for biblical counseling, and based on my core belief in the sufficiency of the Scriptures, I find myself agreeing with his general premise. Where I have questions is how the nuances of interacting with secular study and research are handled. Again, this is outside of the scope of the book, but there were a few strong statements (which we all make as communicators at one time or another) that left me wondering how much room there was to take valuable data from outside the realm of biblical counseling and incorporate it into our biblical approach. <br /></p>
<p>Lambert finishes out the rest of the book with relating biblical counseling to the major divisions of theology with a few other real life scenarios that a biblical counselor will face. <br /></p>
<p>I listened to the Audible version of this book, and I am sure there are some differences to the book because the Audible version was recorded lectures. I plan to read the book in the next month. I will add to this review then if there is anything that strikes me as needful to add.</p>"

Most readers will not feel like this is a textbook, yet for those who would like the academics of this, Enod sites other helpful sources occasionally as well. She also has a good balance of story, diagnostic, and analysis. <br /></p>
<p>Occasionally Enod Gray takes aim a churches and spiritual institutions, although this is not overdone. Her points are valid and worthy of consideration.

Carter, S. Bruce Narramore",An Introduction,"<p>This is the first book I have read presenting and defending the integration approach to counseling. I grew up and went to college and seminary being taught a strictly biblical counseling model. Over the last few years, I have read many books written strictly from the world of psychology and have benefited from them. I still maintain the core tenet of biblical counseling - the sufficiency of Scriptures; however, since I have benefited from a secular description of human brokenness (I am not talking about the secular presuppositions), I was curious what I would think of a formal presentation of an integrationist approach.</p>
<p>I will get right to it. I found myself mostly in agreement with how it was presented in this book. They have done an excellent job laying things out and exploring the things at stake. The key concept that I cannot agree with is putting psychology on equal footing with the Scriptures. John and Bruce do consistently give a nod to the sufficiency of the Scriptures, and they extensively credit the world of psychology under the principal ""the unity of truth"" with the ability to produce knowledge/truth that the Bible does not. I don't think they would say it that way though, and I am not sure how to put it into words yet. They make an excellent and persuasive case. However, I kept on waiting for them to make a clearer statement more along the lines the discipline of psychology more under the Scriptures instead of an equal. They come very close, but not quite.</p>"

Coming from a Christian background where divorce is taboo, my perspective is that many Christians going through divorce can often be less equipped do deal with it properly. Take your view of when you should and shouldn't divorce out of the equation. Divorce still happens when you think it shouldn't. And when you, your peers, or life mentors don't think it should happen, and yet it is happening, the people getting divorced will often find themselves isolated when they need community and care the most. They also need coaching while they navigate a tough time in their life.</p>
<p>Jean McBride takes a common sense and methodical approach to how divorce can be done as well as possible. She takes into account the struggles the adults are having while coaching them how to help their children. The book is relatively short, and it is easy to read. If my parents had even done a third of the things McBride talks about in this book, it would have been a dramatic help to me and my younger sisters. <br /></p>
<p>If you know someone who is going through a divorce, buy this book and read it. Put aside your opinions about whether they should divorce, come along side of them, and help them work through it with the practical items Jean McBride gives us. I understand sometimes you need to challenge a brother or sister in Christ about whether they should be getting a divorce. I am not saying you shouldn't do that. What I am saying is that you SHOULD NOT abandon them once they are going forward with the divorce.</p>"

<p>The book doesn't look like it is very ""academic."" It is rather short, and it doesn't really have many footnotes. Palmer doesn't cite many other works. However, his writing style is rich enough, that it will be a challenge for readers who are used to reading books with a lot of stories and illustration.

I had this feeling of, <em>I doubt this is going to be very helpful. </em>As I read this book, my initial prejudice evaporated away and respect and appreciation began to rise. The authors are fairly through in considering the complexities of life and attitudes that can lead to burnout. They have several lengthy diagnostic sections along with helpful stories and illustrations. The balance between Scripture, illustration, story, diagnostics, and application is well done.</p>
<p>I do believe there was one aspect that was lacking here. They didn't touch at all (I think) on the complexities of how someone was raised and how that can lead to burnout. That, to me, is a significant omission. If they did touch on it, I either missed it or it was really brief. Helping people think through burnout without this component can significantly hinder impact.</p>"

His process of ""thawing"" (or dealing with repressed childhood issues) is the most involved I have read so far. I think using the word ""abandonment"" in the title is a little misleading. Abandonment is addressed through out the book, but it is one of many things addressed. <br /></p>
<p>I also felt like the solution process Carter lays out is a little too repetitive for a book. I think it is great for a therapy sessions over several months, but I wonder if many readers will begin to tune out. Finally, there are many helpful descriptions of the emotional issues adults can face because of bad childhood experiences.</p>"

The main focus of the book, the New Covenant as the title intimates, is thoroughly dealt with, and I appreciate this about the book. Charismatic theology is also extensively interacted with as it is a natural consideration when the New Covenant and what that means is being studied.

<ul><li>There was a lot of overlap as the book seems to be almost a collection of essays. <br /></li><li>There is an extra layer of dogmatism that I feel is unnecessary and hurtful to trying to restore people biblically. </li><li>There is a lot of missed opportunity for helpful nuance in dealing with the world of psychology while at the same time continuing to be faithful to the Scriptures. The subtitle of this book could almost be, ""A case for why there is nothing good in psychology and why it goes directly against the Bible. And, I know many would say, ""That is absolutely correct!"" My opinion is that is actually unnecessarily harmful. I have read many other biblical counseling books that do a better job with this. <br /></li></ul><p>I do appreciate several things about this book as well:</p>

Aside from that, JH Simon has written a pretty helpful book on narcissism. I wish it were more academic and that he had cited sources. Yet, maybe the fact that he didn't makes the book more accessible to some folks who won't read more academic sounding/feeling books. <br /></p>
<p>I appreciate how Simon gives clear descriptions and then offers helpful solutions at the end of the book. Oh, and there was a random John Piper quote at the beginning of a chapter. Not what I was expecting. It was a good quote, and I value John Piper, it is just not what you would expect in a secular book on narcissism. Speaking of this book being secular, I write/think from a Christian world view. As is common with a secular book, there are many lines you will read and disagree with. Yet, much of this book serves as a helpful diagnostic when people are trying to make sense of toxic people in their lives.</p>"

His premise of the ""dynamic heart"" is truly profound. Sometimes I have felt that Biblical counseling fails to take in the complexity of the human experience while at the same time criticizing those who do as being unbiblical. This is simplistic - I know. Yet, I think there is some validity to it. Jeremy brings some more breadth and depth to the handling of human experience in biblical counseling. He even briefly deals with the physical body and safety. This doesn't seem to be dealt with much in biblical counseling. Maybe I will stand corrected the more reading I do, but it seems that Jeremy feels the need to defend even bringing this up if you read the footnote number three in chapter 5 (page 248). <br /></p>
<p>I thought that the third and last section of the book wasn't as good as the first two sections. It felt very repetitive and mechanical in such a ""dynamic"" book. I <em>would</em> call this section thorough though. If you want to get your mind going before a counseling appointment, skimming this third section would be helpful. </p>"

Its click-bait title is annoying and will inevitably cause a more than occasional eye roll. The first part of the book is depressing and it can feel overstated. Just read some people's reviews of it and you can see this affect is common. I actually started the book and then put it down for a few months.</p>
<p>Bruce is not a reactionary, a blowhard, nor a conspiracy theorist. He deals with the inconvenient realities of internet security that we don't want to hear. His approach is data-driven and permeated with real world examples. He doesn't just tell us the problem. He offers a detailed solution as well. <br /></p>

Those of you who know me know that I tend to like less stories and more core content. Don't misunderstand me, there is a lot of content here, just more stories than I would prefer. <br /></p>
<p>The biggest drawback to this book is that although Jon Acuff is a Christian, the book was written for mass appeal with Christ not even really mentioned. It is not that what Jon shares is bad, I believe it is good. I just believe it could be much better with it centered on Christ. He would have less mass appeal, but he would have....well... a better finish!</p>"

Since then I have done a lot of reading in the realm of secular psychology. I remain committed to the sufficiency of Scripture, but I have discovered a lot of helpful tools and metrics used in secular psychology since my college &amp; seminary days. A broad-brushed feeling I had of these resources right after my schooling was that these resources were suspect at best and more likely just not good at all. I know that isn't a fair representation in many cases, it was just what I left my schooling with. <br /></p>
<p>Although dealing with this deeply isn't the scope of Heath Lambert's book, I felt like he at least gave a helpful, detailed handling of it. He begins the book sorting out what he calls ""Christian Counseling"" versus ""Biblical Counseling"" and where they are similar and where they are different. Naturally, he makes his case for biblical counseling, and based on my core belief in the sufficiency of the Scriptures, I find myself agreeing with his general premise. Where I have questions is how the nuances of interacting with secular study and research are handled. Again, this is outside of the scope of the book, but there were a few strong statements (which we all make as communicators at one time or another) that left me wondering how much room there was to take valuable data from outside the realm of biblical counseling and incorporate it into our biblical approach. <br /></p>
<p>Lambert finishes out the rest of the book with relating biblical counseling to the major divisions of theology with a few other real life scenarios that a biblical counselor will face. <br /></p>
<p>I listened to the Audible version of this book, and I am sure there are some differences to the book because the Audible version was recorded lectures. I plan to read the book in the next month. I will add to this review then if there is anything that strikes me as needful to add. </p>"

<p>I just finished Andrew Lombardi's book on the topic and I am mildly pleased.

My brother-in-law saw me when I was reading this book on China, and he quipped, ""Isn't that book a little small to be covering the history of China?"" Truly this book is just over 500 pages. What is impressive about it in my novice opinion, is that it does the job. It gives detail, but it covers material fast. And, it gives a generous citing of sources for further, deeper study. <br /></p>
<p>I found the first 3600 years of Chinese history to be tough to read mainly because China doesn't interact much with the outside world during this time. But, around 600 AD, this changed. I expect as I study the history of China more, I will be able to think more about these early years. After reading this book, I have a basic matrix of Chinese history. It is a good starting point for future study.</p>"

There was a total absence of these in the book. Stuart's sole emphasis for church revitalization was on church leadership. In the sense of challenging church leaders, I think this was an excellent book. The only weakness in this regard is that I don't think Stuart gave enough acknowledgement to the various polities and how that in itself is a significant struggle for churches.</p>
<p>As far as church revitalization as a whole, I think there are significant gaps that Robert Stuart leaves. If he had named the book something related to leadership development and church revitalization, then the book wouldn't leave you with gaps. But since the book assumes the topic of church revitalization as a whole, then there is a lot more that needs to be said.</p>"

The book is filled with stories bearing out Gabor's point. I believe the manifold stories are helpful for people to identify with their own situations and help them get past their own mental blocks. As I read the book, I did begin to skip many of the stories, because the plot-lines (rightly so) all played out the same. The repetition of the plot line does seem necessary since people have collectively been conditioned (or they have passively lost a grip on it) to miss the stress-disease connection.</p>
<p>Gabor does not claim to be a Christian and he occasionally takes aim at Christian belief. As I perceive it, this is not a malicious attempt at undermining faith. This is a doctor who has seen many people, Christian or non-Christian not coming to grips with a proper handling of stress in their lives. I encourage you not to tune out as soon as someone criticizes Christianity. Instead, think, pray, and grow in your understanding with God's help. <br /></p>
<p>This book has a lot of footnotes for those who would like to dig deeper. It is accessible and also comprehensive. My one negative for the book is not necessarily the author's fault.

The Enigma Code Breakers is a fascinating outlay of how the secret British group of code breakers at Bletchley Park played an increasingly more integral role in World War 2 Successes.

German Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt expressed to his interrogators at the end of the war, ""I don't understand how you could more or less be everywhere at once..."".</p>
<p>I had two frustrations with this book - one because of me and one because of the author (I think). My problem was that I still don't know enough about WW2, and this book isn't about that. Instead it traces the role of these code breakers throughout the war. <br /></p>
<p>One mistake Michael Kerrigan made (I think) is transitioning to using these code breakers interchangeably as ULTRA. I think the transition happened at page 51, but it wasn't clear. I could have missed where the transition was made clear which is why I say I think this was an author issue.</p>"

Over the last couple of years I have been studying this, and I am glad I have! There are measurable physiological responses that go along with life after trauma. To help someone with trauma using only spiritual concepts without helping them handle what is going on physiologically can be counterproductive. <br /></p>
<p>Kain and Terrell give a practical and accessible approach stepping clinicians though how to recognize somatic considerations and then how to deal with them. I do not consider myself a clinician, but I do consider myself someone who helps people deal with trauma. <br /></p>
<p>I found this book fairly concise without a lot of overlap. There is some, but it wasn't bothersome to me. There was a lot of overlap from other books I have read. Thus, someone who has done a lot of reading on this topic already will experience a lot of reinforcement. The authors' effort to make this an integrative approach necessitates this. <br /></p>
<p>There were two important concepts in this book that were especially helpful to me. First, it was here that I read my first substantive definition and explanation of what safety is. Perhaps it was in other books I have read, but it stood out for me in this book. <br /></p>
<p>Second, this book describes what they call a ""Window of Tolerance"" and then a ""Faux Window of Tolerance"" along with ""defense accommodations."" People who have gone through trauma experience the brokenness of not being able to process reality or to process what is going on inside of them (somaticaly or psychologically). The concept of a window of tolerance is great matrix that equips clinicians, mentors, and friends to understand what is going on in the person they are trying to help. </p>"

At the same time other Christians reveal a shocking capacity for spiritual pride, hubris. Without an adequate base for comparisons they spring to the defense of their way as the best way—their party as the superior party. Finally, many Christians engage in some form of ministry without the advantage of a broader context for their labor. When they want to make the best use of their time or their efforts, they have no basis for sound judgment.""</em> [1]</p>

I know they enjoyed it some because I have since heard the kids sing with the tune I assigned,<br /><br /><em>Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-- <br />Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of fum!</em></p>"

Anybody interested in the inner workings of people, culture, and communication will find value in this book. Malcolm takes very explosive US events, takes us deeper, and compels us to think differently about them. This is something our culture desperately needs. Although, it may even be a foreign language to us by now.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell uses a lot of stories, and I believe he uses them effectively. For some, the number of stories will help them digest the material. For others, it may cause the premise to be lost because they don't want to wade through all the stories to get to a small amount of core content. My work around was to listen to the book on 1.5x speed as to be able to get his premise and his stories without getting sick of the lack of core content.</p>
<p>There was a significant negative for me in this book - there were quite a few explicit sexual references. I understand the necessity of many of them. I am not saying he should have left them out. I don't have an opinion on that. I personally just don't want the experience of wading through those types of details.</p>"

He covers religious, cultural, governmental, and the international placement of Iran. </p>
<p>Although I have not done enough reading on Iran to say much, It seems to me Amanat's portrayal of Iran is essentially insightful for us to understand the Iran we see today. Many people do not understand the historical complex relationship that Iran has had with the international community. To assess Iran without these understandings is simplistic and unhelpful although a natural path of least resistance for most people. </p>
<p>My advice to people who realize they need to learn more about Iran is to pick up this book and read through it's major highlights. Don't feel the need to get everything on the first read through. Or, find a shorter book with less detail but with overarching themes. </p>

There were too many new concepts to fill out, and Epstein gives you plenty interesting real life examples to fill out his concepts. Often I will get bored with an author because of their repetition, wordiness, over use of illustration, etc. David does use a lot of real life examples, but they were unique enough and complex enough that I couldn't just skip read. Perhaps if I was more familiar with his concepts already, I would have been able to skip read. </p>
<p>I've wrote a lot and haven't even touched on the book's content.</p>
<p>David Epstein shows how the rewarded and prominent path to ""success"" has been early-specialization in a field and / or specialization period. He systemically demonstrates the dangers of this. One of his examples was that people were working in parallel trenches, digging deep into their trench of speciality. And, they don't stop to look at other trenches. And yet, we live in a ""wicked world"" that demolishes people who have not considered complex, interconnected realities. People are trenching down in a specialty and they are missing the obvious. </p>
<p>No only are people not able to consider an ""outsider perspective"" to their specialty, but David shows that the more they specialize the more unable they are able to solve a problem. In addition, our society doesn't reward people who don't show results fast within a narrow field. Inter-disciplinary approaches to life take more time and often show up much later in life. By that point, a person feels behind everyone else, and often everyone else looks at that person as non-productive. David peels back layers of sociology and studies people's behavior patterns surrounding these realities. He takes you through case study after case study to help you think through this. Inter-Disciplinary studies are also statistically more likely to be overlooked and ignored yet with much greater long-term success.</p>
<p>I would have to say at this point, this is one of the more valuable books I have read. It provokes needful thought.</p>"

Lewis,null,"<p>My journey through this book (or shall we say all seven books contained within this volume) has brought me an experience I have never had before. It is an experience that I hope I never go without for long from this time forth. I travelled through this book with my two oldest children and my reader’s voice. I watched their faces, their eyes, their preoccupations, their dispositions, and their positions as the syllables rolled off my tongue. The story alone unleashes wave after wave of fantastical wonder, but the story together brings a prelude of eternal joys of fellowship that await the children of God.</p>
<p>Skeptical? So was I!</p>
<p>Lewis provides many Narnian ebbs and flows. Sometimes you feel like it is a little dry, and you wonder why he wrote what he did, and other times the delights dance delightfully through you. I especially began to question Lewis as I made my way through the first half of the last book (Book 7). I felt let down as I read this one. The others seemed so much better and more Narnian than this one. I had felt this here and there through some of the other books, but not like I did with this last one. </p>
<p>As I tried to use the right voices, watch my children’s faces, and digest the plot together with them, I was not prepared for what C.S. Lewis had in store for us. He had led us down a dark, but realistic path. My children didn’t seem to be bothered like I was. I kept on thinking, “so this is it...”. </p>
<p>And then, he did it again. </p>
<p>C.S. Lewis unleashed Narnia upon us more than ever. </p>
<p>Maybe...just perhaps...I could have... moved the book a little closer to my face and out of view from my children so they couldn’t see my contorted face. I possibly could have had to stop between words and sentences...sometimes for ten seconds or more to maintain my composure and hold back the tide within my soul. For, Lewis was bonding the fantastical with the spiritual, our reality with beautiful aforementions of our unknown eternity, and displays of Aslan woven together with the majesty of our God. </p>
<p>And just think, I traveled this journey not alone.</p>"

Some reasons for fast reads include easy to digest fiction, less pages, or easy to skim and still get its ideas. Some reasons for slow reads include a totally new concept, highly technical, or requires a lot of meditation. The Emotionally Healthy Leader by Peter Scazzero was a slow read for me because it required a lot of meditation. It covers both theology and practice with a lot of illustration. Typically I could read a book like this much faster; however, I think it touched on many areas that I need to consider. </p>
<p>The Emotionally Healthy Leader is unlike any book on leadership I have read. I am still considering the reasons that set it apart from others. I think perhaps the biggest overall reason is that it starts with relationships as the core from which everything else flows out of. Almost any good leadership book is going to deal with relationships in some form. Yet, I think most other books treat relationship as an aspect along with many other aspects. </p>
<p>Scazzero looks at your core relationships with God and with your spouse or your key relationships as a single person. He uses these core relationships to define a life rhythm. I don't think I have read another book that deals with this extensively. Instead a few words, paragraphs, and maybe even a chapter are given to this. Yet, the leadership culture that we step into these days will quickly put the squeeze on these foundational relationships. This is expected and ""goes along with the territory"" in our minds. We think part of leading is to learn balance and tradeoffs without sacrificing our families. There is truth to this thinking, but it seems it doesn't quite give us the answers we need. Peter Scazzero extensively lays out a healthier way of leading by explaining how our core relationships are our starting point that define what we can do as a leader. </p>
<p>I suggest that any Christian Leader should make this one of their most important books to read. </p>"

What I am saying is that many books by the nature of this topic will, to some degree, stir up desire in people. I found that experience to be absent as I read this book.

You may not agree with everything he says, but be careful not to give yourself or the person you are seeking to help a pass and thereby damaging ability to truly deal with the issue.</p>"

Porges,The Transformative Power of Feeling Safe,"<p>Stephen Porges extensively details the physiological reality of safety. In other words, what happens in our nervous system for our bodies to feel safe. I think most of us would acknowledge there is interplay between body and soul, but it seems that most of us (at least the people I run with and including myself) have not given thought to what our bodies are communicating to us. </p>
<p>My largest take-away for the book was explanation on how nervous system can respond beyond the fight or flight reaction. The Polyvagel theory deals with the secondary way our nervous system can deal with a threat - immobilization. This gave me a category that I didn't have before, and I could easily trace the concept to reality.</p>
<p>The next biggest take-away was the correlation of trauma and immobilization. Although, this theory mostly can only deal with the identification of this correlation. Developing treatment for this, according to Porges, is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>Finally, the book lays out the various ways we can experience safety most notably (in my opinion) including the social interaction factor. This has profound implications for our constant use of media today as it relates to the experiencing physical safety. </p>
<p>I found the book to be very repetitive, and this is in part because of the layout of the book being a series of lectures/conversations. Because the subject matter is rather technical, the repetitiveness would be welcome for some. Also, for those who enjoy story to help them connect to the subject matter will be happy with what they find in this book. The book starts with a glossary of terms. I think this should be moved to the end because this can discourage some readers from making it to the important premise this book presents. </p>

Many folks with my background may not spend time reading books in this category; however, I found it to be valuable and very practically helpful. In my pastoral training, no time was given to describing &amp; and identifying the issues this book does. </p>
<p>The Bible is clear in describing the brokenness of sin, and that is what this book does (from a secular viewpoint). It gives us a methodical way to identify brokenness mentally and emotionally and its affect on us physically. The niche of AEDP therapy is dealing with the emotions in order to bring healing according to this author. </p>
<p>I am not qualified to evaluate this from a professional counselor's perspective. What I will say is that I see great value with God's help to identify brokenness as a pathway to bringing healing that God wants us to experience. The irony of our brokenness is that our ability to diagnose our brokenness is broken! It is always good to have other people, books, and the Holy Spirit himself help us identify our brokenness so we can begin to heal.</p>"

Kraft,Practicing the Authority Jesus Gave Us,"<p>Charles Kraft offers a comprehensive and compelling book detailing his view of the spiritual authority Christians possess today to wage spiritual warfare. Any Bible-minded Christian will find much to agree on here. </p>
<p>That said, there is much to disagree on for some folks as well. The source of the disagreement, in my opinion, lies in the foundational difference between how the Charismatic Movement applies Jesus' words given to the apostles as well as an unwillingness to recognize the distinction between the apostles ministry and the ministry of the church going forward after the apostolic era. </p>
<p>For Charismatics, Kraft's use of Scripture makes perfect sense. For biblically minded, non-Charismatics they will only agree with Kraft up to a point, and then they will become uncomfortable with his conclusions. </p>
<p>I am decidedly on the non-Charismatic end of the spectrum; however, I am not willing to shut the door to God doing special things and special times. What this means practically, is that I am not comfortable Charles Kraft's discussion of how to deal with demons and the spirit world. It is based on assertions that are overlaid on top of interpretations of Scripture that I do not agree with. </p>
<p>Although this is my position, I am not willing to say that these things never happen. I am just in disagreement with the expectation of these things and the normal way of ""conducting business"" with these things that Kraft outlines. </p>
<p>Kraft's book is very popular, and many people won't like it being questioned. When Christians come to difference on these issues, they must be kind and gracious to one another. Usually differences on these issues will not be resolved in a brief conversation if the differences arise from long-term perspectives. No matter what your view, you would benefit from respectfully investigating all sides of the issue.</p>"

Although I deeply disagree with the book, it makes a convincing case for the legitimacy of Homosexuality within Christianity. I am not able to spend the necessary time to deal with this book thoroughly. So, I put four different links below where you can read thorough, biblical handlings of the book. <br /></p>
<p>I do want to, however, share a few of my own thoughts. Before I launch into them, let me say that Matthew Vines is loved by God. He is another person whom Jesus Christ has died for. My desire is to point people to the truth, and sometimes that means I have to go against something that is very popular. Just because I go against this, does not mean that I hate or desire pain for anybody. </p>
<p>In addition, it is good for any Christian leader, mentor, or teacher to read this book before they deal with this topic. If we do not understand how it is presented, then our efforts to teach, train, and mentor will be undermined because we have been cast in a certain light already by those affirming Homosexuality.</p>
<h2>Usually, but not always, people's minds are already made up.</h2>
<p>When people pick up a book like this, they often already have a firm opinion. Their opinion may be formed by what their preferred culture deems right, what their own personal tastes and desires are, or from a traditional view of same-sex relationships given to them by their spiritual mentors. So let's be honest with ourselves as we study this topic. What is the basis or our opinion? </p>
<p>Matthew Vines knows that the number one challenge is the church's traditional understanding of the Bible and human sexuality, and that is what he seeks to overturn, recast, and re-explain. That is why even for those who hold a traditional view of same-sex relationships given to them by their spiritual mentors will still not be properly equipped to handle this topic the way it is being messaged today. The only way to properly deal with this issue as a Christian is to yes know the Bible passages, but also to know what is the proper handling of Scripture.</p>
<h2>The Use of Story Telling and Belonging</h2>
<p>Matthew powerfully intertwines his own story and desire to belong and be affirmed by those in his life throughout this book. Who doesn't want the good feelings of being accepted and affirmed? The difficulty for any decent human being is deciding what to accept, and who gets to say what is okay and what is not okay. The human heart because of in-born sin will love the wrong things while at the same time making a case for why those things are okay. If we place the power of the story, our experience, and our desire to belong above objective truth, we will be subject to the result of our own desires instead of the result of the purity of God's glory and truth. </p>
<h2>Creating a New Category</h2>
<p>A key part of Matthew's premise is taking what is true about himself, his desire for a faithful union with another man, and creating a category for it that he says that Bible doesn't directly address. Therefore, he makes an argument from supposed silence on why the Bible is okay with Homosexuality. In addition, he spends a good deal of time explaining why the classic Bible passages on Homosexuality can't apply to his desire for a faithful union with another man. This leads to my next thought.</p>
<h2>What is a high view of Scripture?</h2>
<p>Since the Bible is the Christian's authority, Vines knows that he must deal with this topic. He seeks to prove that he still has a high view of Scripture while at the same time messing around with word meanings and very nuanced arguments so that he can have his category of Same-Sex Attraction. Whenever we take our category and seek to make room for it in Scripture, we do not have a high view of the Bible. The articles below deal with this more extensively. It is noteworthy that when we treat Scripture the way Matthew does that we are then in danger of the continual erosion of a healthy relationship with the Word of God. We will continue to explain away things and will then be on the path towards relativism and license for anything we want. </p>

As the author points out, people naturally have a low self-awareness. It is never fun to be under a leader who ""just doesn't get it"" about themselves and how they affect others. Terry has given us a book that anybody who takes time to ready it can appreciate. He gives practical steps at the end of each chapter, and he powerfully uses story telling to illustrate his point.</p>"

They are practical and thoughtful, and they are written as a coach seeks to help his players understand the nature of the game. Rainer steps church leaders outside of their ministry tunnel vision and helps them see their church from the eyes of a visitor. This book is short and to the point. Most people could read it in an afternoon. You won't agree with everything he has to say, but he will make you think.</p>"

Jonathan has written a simple, direct book on this topic. It is open and honest, but it isn't overdone. Although talking about such things can stir things up in you, Jonathan is weaves Scriptural, practical, and statistical information pervasively throughout the book which keeps you from missing the point in the midst of the topic matter. We shouldn't continue live in a culture that treats sex as it shouldn't without doing anything about it. We should train ourselves to think right about sex so that we can interact with our sexuality as we should. We should do this because sex matters.</p>"

What makes him even more enjoyable to me is his Jewish heritage combined with his Faith in Jesus Christ. I think, if I remember right, this was Joel's first attempt at Historical Fiction, and he does not disappoint! He does a great job helping you appreciate cultural mindsets, relationship dynamics, and plausible situations.</p>"

It presents some worthwhile considerations in our new world of big Computer Tech Companies. I remember as a child many...many...many years ago hearing adults discussing the onset of Walmart and what that meant for the small, local stores. Today, Walmart is a part of yesterday's news and discussions, and Amazon, Facebook, Apple, etc. are a the big players that dominate the conversations today. Not <em>as</em> many years ago, I remember the anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft. And, if you want to go way back, we can talk about AT&amp;T. <br /></p>
<p>But what about today's big tech companies? <br /></p>
<p>Franklin Foer in <em>""World without Mind</em>"" steps us through these considerations. He looks at why we don't read about anti-trust lawsuits with these companies. He also shares his own personal experience with what he calls ""The Existential Threat of Big Tech Companies."" <br /></p>
<p>You don't have to be a tech nerd to appreciate what Franklin has to say. This is not a technincal book. You will need to be the type of person that likes to think about business, business practice, privacy, and capitalism and its counterparts. </p>"

One, because it is a window into the Green family and the Hobby Lobby stores. Two, because the Green family has immense wealth and how they manage it seeking to glorify God with it. And finally, because David Green offers concrete steps to handle money no matter where you are on the money scale. I look forward to re-reading this again.</p>"

The format of the book is heavily story-based, and while that is not normally my preference, I believe it is necessarily to help build the foundation for understanding that Nadine is attempting to develop in readers. Not only is she trying to raise awareness, along with that is a pervasive mental block to this understanding. Thus, it needs more than just presenting the concept. Harris lays out the challenges she faced over many years of attempting to present these concepts. This helps us understand why people struggle digest these things.</p>
<p>As I care for people in a the spiritual realm, I have gained great insight in seeking an interdisciplinary approach. I may not agree with the world view usually presented in these types of works, I always walk away with many more tools to help me understand how God has made us, the extent of the effects of brokenness in a person, and new insights with how to help a person process brokenness with God's help. </p>"

It is hard to read the book for a long period of time without stopping and praying. Paul Miller deals both in the theological realm and the practical, and he encapsulates the normal American Christian way of looking at prayer. As you experience this, you begin to see where your American Christianity has blinded you to what could be a vibrant relationship with your Master, and you long to quickly remedy that. The friend who recommended it to me said, “It is not one of those books on prayer that make you feel guilty when you read it.” I really didn’t believe him. But, he was right.</p>
<p>Naturally there are a few things in the book that I don’t agree with, and as we should do with any book, we should read with discernment. One notable thing that bothered me is that Paul Miller quotes N. T. Wright (once I think). I have not been able to study N. T. Wright's positions personally, but I have heard several others concerned with his New Perspective on Paul.</p>"

I read them about 10 years ago, but I thought I would share a basic overview. Without a doubt, these books are among the classics and in the ""must read"" territory for those that like to study history. I suppose the fact that they are a four volume set might be intimidating for some, but I encourage you not to let that get in the way.</p>
<p>Naturally these books are thorough, and I still have some of their concepts that flash through my head to this day. Churchill does have the ability to weave the fabric of a situation fairly well as a good historical novelist should. I rank his ability in that area as decent. I have read those who do a better job. <br /></p>
<p>I look forward to re-reading these books someday after I have ready a few other extensive comparable histories. I wonder how much of Churchill's presentation will hold up to other works.</p>"

I think it would help many people as they try to make sense of the political climate today for them to read this. In some ways, things aren't all that different now than they were then. <br /><br />Although I thought this was well written, I found it hard to finish. The deism combined with the paganism of Ben Franklin was depressing to me.</p>"

When the Bible uses the word ""heaven,"" what does it mean? Wilbur Smith in his ""The Biblical Doctrine of Heaven"" gives us a systematic theology of heaven. I read it over 10 years ago, and now as I think about it, I look forward to reading it again some day. Smith is very thorough and scholarly, yet readable as well.</p>"

Since then, I know that Barton ran into some trouble with his scholarship. I don't know what the outcome of that was. Either way, I think his book is worth reading. It is repetitive and tedious, but there is enough material in there to provoke serious thought. I did edit my original review from 2008 a little since I am not sure I agree with myself totally from then!</p>
<p>Most people understand that there has been somewhat of a shift in the mindset of the leadership of our country; however, sometimes it is hard to figure out where the shift occurred and why our country operates the way it does now (in contrast to what we have heard it has operated in the past). For example, we know that we have not always had to deal with this heavy-handed approach to any form of public religious expression by our government. But, we are not sure why, how, or if it should be this way. Perhaps you have done a little more thinking and research about this than the average person. Yet, you probably still have a sense of what has happened, but you don’t know how to present it and you still aren’t sure if you could prove it. </p>
<p>David Barton in Original Intent presents an argument that explains the Original Intent of the governing documents and the founding fathers convictions regarding religious expression in the United States. His support is so thorough and what he presents is so radically different from what we are hearing today, that it is alarming that our current system from the last 50 years has had the audacity to shift in such a manner. David Barton also answers how the current system has accomplished this, and why we haven’t been able to do anything about it. And finally, after all this, he presents four steps we can follow that will lead us back to the Original Intent of the Founders.</p>"
